		<p>Subscript and superscript can make all the difference when it comes to chemical formulas.<br>
Molecules, compounds, and other chemical structures include more than one atom. Sometimes, there are multiples of one particular atom.<br>
For instance, anhydrous aluminum chloride features one atom of aluminum joined to or combined with three atoms of chlorine. Its chemical formula reflects this: AlCl₃.But – simply knowing how to use a number in this instance is not enough. It is essential to know the proper use of subscripts and superscripts.</p>

    	<h1>Subscripts in Chemistry</h1>

<p>Notice the number 3 is written as a subscript, or a number that is smaller than the other text, and below the normal text line, in the formula for anhydrous aluminum chloride above. The concept of a multiplicity of atoms is conveyed by this use of a subscript.<br><br><i>For reference please check</i> <a href="gallery.html" target="_blank">Fig1.1</a></p>

       <h1>Superscripts in Chemistry</h1>
<p>Atoms often occur as combinations of isotopes. Hydrogen, the simplest gaseous element, has one electron and one proton in all its atoms. However, a small percentage of hydrogen atoms also have a neutron in the nucleus. This form of hydrogen atom is, naturally, heavier than the hydrogen without a neutron. To distinguish them, a superscript is employed. The letter H with a left-justified superscript symbol 1, written <sup>1</sup>H, represents hydrogen containing one nucleon – that is one nuclear particle – a lone proton. On the other hand, the symbolism <sup>2</sup>H represents the deuterium form of hydrogen, which contains 2 nucleons – one proton and one neutron. If there is a subscript below the superscript, it indicates the number of protons, only.<br><br><i>For reference please check</i> <a href="gallery.html" target="_blank">Fig1.1</a></p>
